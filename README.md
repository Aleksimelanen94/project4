I spent way too much time trying to figure out why i could not get my API to show on the page and i eventually gave up.
I hope you can give me feedback on why it doesnt work at all even when i have my server on and i can see that on "http://localhost:8080/api/getall"
it shows all the data on json form.

Not being able to get any of my data to show on the page made it really difficult to get my application done. I tried everything. Even with just copying lecture code i could not get it to work.

I then moved on to make some inputfields and other stuff and my application code just got messier to the point when i was running out of time to get anything working properly.
I hope i get even just some points from trying.

If you can give me some solution to why information is not showing i can try to fix it if you give me another attempt on the assingment.

At least i got cool button to work from "https://mui.com/".
